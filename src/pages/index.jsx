      <p>
        Every retailer is unique though, and at Vend we want to fit around the
        way you work, not force you to mould your business around the way we
        work. Thatâ€™s why we offer you choice in terms of ecommerce and
        accounting partners (so you can choose what works best for you) and why
        we partner with many payment providers, rather than forcing you to use
        our rate.
